# Skafos Example Models on Google Colab
A collection of Google Colaboratory notebooks for example [TuriCreate](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) models. When possible, these runtime
environments, hosted by Google, will use a GPU for accelerated model training. At the end of each example notebook, 
you will have the ability to download a trained [CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) model that
you can deliver over-the-air with [**Skafos.ai**](https://skafos.ai).
