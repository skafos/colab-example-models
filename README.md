# Skafos Example Models on Google Colab
A collection of Google Colaboratory notebooks for training different machine learning models with
[TuriCreate](https://github.com/apple/turicreate). When possible, these runtime
environments, hosted by Google, will use a GPU for accelerated model training. At the end of each example notebook, 
you will download a trained [CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) model that
you can deliver over-the-air with [Skafos.ai](https://skafos.ai) to your iOS application.

## Object Detection (Uses GPU)
Detect location and identity of objects within images.
- **People, Bikes, and Cars**:

## Text Classification
Classify chunks of user text into different categories.
- **Sentiment Classifier**:
